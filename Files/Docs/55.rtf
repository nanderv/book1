\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f1\fs36\b1\i1 Introduction}{\f1\fs24\b1\i1 \line Most people spend their entire lives wondering why things in their lives turned out the way they did. Most people will never find this out. I\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92m both blessed and cursed by actually knowing what major events shaped my life. I\u8217\'92m both figuratively and literally at the center of this story. This is my story on who made my life the life it was.\line \line To tell a story, it\u8217\'92s best to tell the stories of the people who made it happen. Every event has a person who made it happen. It was originated from a choice of a person, who may have had a chance to change it. This is not a story of blame, but rather, an intriguing thought experiment from an observer. And, since the world is at it\u8217\'92s end anyway, there\u8217\'92s not much left to get angry about. }
