\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \line }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 I remember the dreams of that night. The Entity had a message for me. The dream this time was simple. I was asked to be careful, to prevent making stupid mistakes. I wasn\loch\af2\hich\af2\dbch\af2\uc1\u8217\'92t sure what it meant with that, but didn\u8217\'92t have time to ask questions before waking up. I marveled at the convenience it had with when I woke up, and wondered if it was a coincidence.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \line I ate breakfast, and got ready for work. As I was about to leave, the phone in my room rang. It was miss Walters, wishing me good luck. I thanked her, and went on my way. It seemed my route to work took forever, as well as being over in a mere second. I was prepared, but nevertheless, it felt strange to be talking to one of the worlds biggest criminals. I was told to keep open dialog, and give him the chance to speak openly. This surprised me, because he could very well be trying to convince people that he wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t that bad. When I entered the studio, it was still empty. I sat down on my chair, and read through my notes. I rehearsed my first few questions. After that, I took a few minutes to relax. I felt a calm starting to surround me, as though I knew I would be able to do this. At this moment, someone entered the room, and asked me if I was ready. I took a deep breath, and said that I was.\line I was surprised of him as he entered the room. He looked less like a horrible terrorist, and more like a philosophy major student. He kindly greeted me with a friendly hi. I stood up, and shook his hand, while I was feeling very conflicted about this situation. He introduced himself as William Fords, political activist. I thought that that was a weird way to say terrorist, but didn\u8217\'92t say it. He answered the remark I didn\u8217\'92t make by saying that he knew he was known as a terrorist, but that he never intended anything like this to happen, and still didn\u8217\'92t understand how it could happen. I sighed, and said that it would perhaps be better to just start the interview.\line \line We took our seats, and the camera started running. He seemed stressed, as I know I also was. We started simple, by introducing ourselves. I introduced myself simply as Violet Watts, he also only used his name. \line I started by asking him why he started }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 the Voice of Reason}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 . He replied that he felt that the Council didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t listen to the voice of the people enough, instead only focusing on what they thought would be important. He explained that a lot of people are suffering outside the Capital, because of a lack of food, or other basic necessities. Therefore, he started a political group, which wanted to know the reasoning of the Council, and wanted to get involved in the decision making process. So, he said, we only wanted to have a voice, and be listened to.\line I asked why they started to rebel then. He answered that the Council didn\u8217\'92t offer them any way to react, only acting as though they listened, and never saying what was done with the feedback they were given. I thought for a moment, and asked him: \u8220\'93But, just putting it bluntly, why kill children?\u8221\'94. He started crying. I waited for a moment, and continued: \u8220\'93Is it such a tough question?\u8221\'94. He struggled to get himself together again, and answered, with a small voice: \u8220\'93I never meant for this to happen, this wasn\u8217\'92t what we set out to do.\u8221\'94. }
\par\plain {\f2\fs24\b0\i1\ul\ulc0 \line  Meanwhile, William was also surprised at this situation, he had expected the interviewer to be a much more controlling or awful person. Violet, to him, seemed like a reasonable person. This confused him, because he had thought of Council members as being all evil. After all, they had killed off innocent people, just because they were his friends.}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \line \line I continued with another question: \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s a cheap thing to say; after all, you\u8217\'92re responsible for the organization you started. You taught people to hate the established government. Just because some people took it a step further than you expected doesn\u8217\'92t mean you lose responsibility, right?\u8221\'94 William seemed to lose his nerve, and answered: \u8220\'93You seem very quick to judge a person by acts that were committed in his name. Our organization has always made it clear internally that we didn\u8217\'92t want to hurt anyone. We actively worked on finding out who had aggressive tendencies, and even reported some potential threats to the police. We\u8217\'92re, to this day, unsure who committed the terrorist attack, and we didn\u8217\'92t find anyone within our organization who knew him. For all intents and purposes, he didn\u8217\'92t exist.\u8221\'94. I was confused by his words. After all, it had been all over the news that the cell had been in close contact with the leadership of }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 the Voice. }{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 I didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t understand why he was lying so blatantly. He was a good liar though, he almost managed to convince me. I asked him why he was lying to me. He looked at me as though he didn\u8217\'92t understand me. I elaborated: \u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t act surprised. You\u8217\'92 re telling me you never knew these people, but it has been all over the news that the terrorist was known by the leadership of }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 the Voice.}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  So, you\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92re telling me that you really didn\u8217\'92t know of this?\u8221\'94 He went silent and scratched his head. It seemed I had caught him. I let him think for another minute though, because I wanted him to come up with a reaction of his own. He sighed, and finally replied by stating that either means that he\u8217\'92s bad at judging character, or that the news here doesn\u8217\'92t always tell the truth. He asked me if I had heard of the killings on his home shard. I said I had heard of the group of criminals that got convicted there, but asked why it was relevant.\line He sighed. He asked if I really didn\u8217\'92t know what had happened there. I replied that I didn\u8217\'92t follow him at all. \line The conversation seemed to go nowhere after that. Shortly after, the broadcast ended, because we ran out of our time slot. After the recordings, we kept talking. I wanted to know more about this person, because I felt like he didn\u8217\'92t have the personality that would fit the crimes he had committed. But, it seemed I hit a wall, and that he didn\u8217\'92t want to admit what he had done wrong. \line \line }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 It seemed Violet just didn\loch\af2\hich\af2\dbch\af2\uc1\u8217\'92t want to understand. I still don\u8217\'92t get it, the evidence was all there, but it\u8217\'92s as though she just didn\u8217\'92t want to see it. However, in a strange way, it seemed we were starting to come to some understanding. It seemed as though at least we understood why the other thought the way the other did, even though we didn\u8217\'92t even come to agreement on the facts on which the thoughts were based.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs24\b0\i1 \line }{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 We had our second television broadcast a week later. I wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t too hopeful, because she didn\u8217\'92t really give me much space to talk freely the previous time, instead only focusing on the crime that killed our organization. As I entered the room, she was already there. She asked me what I thought about the previous time, and if I would want things to change to the format. I thought for a moment, and told her I would like to talk more about the world in general, and less about the acts of terror that had occurred. She hesitated for a moment, and said she would see what she could do to change the balance between these two things a bit, but that the terror couldn\u8217\'92t be put under the rug. After that, we started the second interview. She opened by asking me what it was that motivated us to rebel against the Council, even though the Council was doing good work. I replied: \u8220\'93the Council is indeed doing a lot of good work, and should be congratulated for that. However, freedom should never be something that\u8217\'92s exchanged for convenience, or for help. If people aren\u8217\'92t free to go where they please, and do what they want, they aren\u8217\'92t much more than slaves.\u8221\'94. She asked me how I would see that happen with work that nobody wants to do. I replied that the income for these jobs should then increase, until people want to do that work. She said that the current period is only a temporary one, and that we will reach that period after this. I told her that they might have wanted to tell people that, instead of keeping them under control using lies and threats. If the Council had actually showed a commitment to that, then }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 the Voice}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  would have never been started. She actually agreed to my point, saying that communications from the side of the Council had been bad. I continued, by saying that actually the main sentiment in }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 the Voice}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  was one of \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8216\'91us against them\u8217\'92, caused by a feeling of being treated as lower class citizens. I added that this sentiment was actually proved to be quite correct from my experience here; even the leader of a world wide terrorist organization gets a more comfortable accommodation than any person outside the capital. She looked at me for a moment, seemingly lost in thought. She really seemed to actually try and understand me. I said it saddened me that she and I had become enemies, because it seemed like we could have worked well together. She replied that she at least agreed on that point.\line \line Over the next interviews, we talked about details of life on both sides, and we got to a point where we got into an understanding. We never agreed on the conclusions, but we could at least see each others point of view.  }}
