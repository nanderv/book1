\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f1\fs36\b1 Violet 2}{\f2\fs22\b0\i1 \line After relaying William\loch\af2\hich\af2\dbch\af2\uc1\u8217\'92s final story to the revolutionaries at the Voice, I decided to return to the Capital. When I returned, I was asked what  I had been doing, leaving the Capital without an explicit task. I said that I had a lead there, but it turned out to be nothing. They wanted to ask more questions, but I answered that I had promised the lead to stay anonymous, and didn\u8217\'92t want to break the trust I was given. So, I was let off the hook.\line \line }{\f3\fs22\b0\i0 About a month after William\loch\af3\hich\af3\dbch\af3\uc1\u8217\'92s death, my dreams started to return. I wasn\u8217\'92t sure what they meant this time, but felt like it wanted to teach me something. It seemed unable to explain what it was trying to tell me though. The dreams all went in the same way: first, I was walking on a plane of light, with a starry sky above me. Then, the ground disappeared, and I was floating through the stars. Finally, I fell through a strange hole in the sky, and ended on a small shard. After that, I woke up, every time. Just like the other dreams that were related to the Entity, I felt a strange truthfulness to this dream. My mind was, in a strange way, perfectly certain that this dream was real, in the same way you\u8217\'92re sure that the book you\u8217\'92re holding is real. So, naturally, I was very confused by these dreams. A few nights later, it was as though the dream suddenly got clearer. The dream still started in the same way, with me standing on a sort of plane of light. However, as the plane disappeared, I felt as though I suddenly had wings. I could fly around freely, not bound by gravity, or any other law of physics. As I flew around, I noticed the stars around me changing color. I then heard a voice, which I somehow already recognized. It told me that if I focused, I could change the world around me. So, I concentrated and was able to change the color of the sky around us to a dark blue tint. The Entity said I could do better, if I thought of bigger things. It told me I can already do a lot more than I think I can, but just need to trust myself to do so. I didn\u8217\'92t know what to think of, so I decided to just think about the place where I had spent my last holiday. It took some effort, but after a while, I could feel the sand between my feet. Then, I could see the sea splash near me. I could feel the water stream over my feet, moving the sand underneath me. I turned around, and saw the rocky inland. There was a path going up the cliffs, towards a lighthouse. When I turned around again, I saw a strange man standing there. He wasn\u8217\'92t there during my holidays, so I was surprised. He looked at me for a moment, and then walked towards me. He introduced himself as the Entity, but said he would prefer the name \u8230\'85, because that sounds more like he\u8217\'92s a living being, instead of a monster. He did a step to the right, and suddenly we where on the roof of a giant building. It had become nighttime. He told me that he wasn\u8217\'92t from our universe, and that he had powers that weren\u8217\'92t from this world. Simply put, from the perspective of our world, he could use magic. I looked bewildered at him, but continued listening. He continued, saying he saw in me a person with great potential, if I learned the right things. He told me that people can have an affinity for magic, just like he has. The breaking of the world-border did not only let him through, but also let some magic into our world. This brings risk, but also possibilities. I asked if this meant that I could perform magic, and if so, what kinds of magic. He told me that he was certain I could build an affinity for some types of magic, but wasn\u8217\'92t sure what types would work. Not everyone can do everything, and some types of magic are highly inadvisable to use. I asked him if he could teach me. He nodded, and with a movement of his hands, we changed locations again. This time, we were standing on the top of a hill. First things first, he said, it\u8217\'92s important to realize that, even though we\u8217\'92re in a dream, it still abides mostly by the rules of the real world. He threw a rock off of the hill, and you could see it fall in the same way you\u8217\'92d expect a rock to fall. He said that this made it a good place to train. \line He told me the first thing to realize is that the magic comes from a type of energy that\u8217\'92s around us. It has been there ever since the Event. It streams through the world, in the same way the storm always rotates. Any thing you\u8217\'92re doing with magic is basically changing the flow of this Energy. The Energy can be used for a lot of things, such as looking for things on long distance, or giving someone far away advice. He told me that basically, most of the things books from the old Earth told people about magic was, in some way or another, possible. He said that I would probably be best at observing, since that fits the nature of my character best. This probably also explained me wanting to become a journalist. He told me to focus on something I wanted to find. I thought about my boyfriend, Charles. For a moment, nothing seemed to happen, which frightened me. The chance of him having died during, or after the event was actually quite big. \u8230\'85 told me to relax, and focus on finding him. If I didn\u8217\'92t focus, I wouldn\u8217\'92t find anything, he continued. So, I sighed, and regained my focus. I thought of him, his smile, his eyes, his hair, and could slowly see him stand before me. It was as though I slowly built up the scene of the place where he was. He was living in a farm, somewhere outside the reach of the cable car system. It seemed this shard wasn\u8217\'92t mapped yet. When I looked around, I felt weird. I saw a woman stand near him, with a child next to her. I just knew the child was his, just like I knew the woman was his. I felt my stomach turn. \u8230\'85 must have seen what happened to me, because he broke off the scene. He told me this was the disadvantage of this skill. I could -sometimes- see a scene, but it can also be negative. Also, he warned me, not everything you\u8217\'92re seeing is real. Sometimes you\u8217\'92re seeing your own wishes, or fears. He told me he felt like the scene I just saw was probably real, but added, that it didn\u8217\'92t really matter, because I wasn\u8217\'92t destined to meet Charles again. I started crying, and stumbled out: how do you know all of this? The reply was, because I\u8217\'92m powerful to the point where I might as well be a god. I looked at him for a moment, and nodded. I mean, really, yes, he is a god. He broke apart the earth, and rebuilt it. His will is what made this world the way it is now. He then told me I had learned enough today, and should get some normal sleep before waking up. I nodded in agreement, and, with a movement of a hand, he changed the world into a sleeping room. I laid down on the bed, and fell asleep. No significant dreams were dreamed from there, and I woke up in the normal reality again. I woke up in confusion, and with a heavy headache. I drank a glass of water, followed by a cup of coffee, and my head seemed to calm down again.\line \line I then went to work, still thinking of what I had seen the night before. My task for today was writing about the way the world had turned more peaceful, without the revolutionaries fucking everything up. I thought, sarcastically, that this would probably change again soon. Christopher didn\u8217\'92t seem like the kind of person to give up on his dreams. But, that\u8217\'92s not something the people in the Capital had any interest in reading, so I wasn\u8217\'92t writing about that. Instead, I wrote about how order had, once again, prevailed. I finished my work without interesting things happening, and went back home. As I entered home, I heard about the cable car strike. I was not surprised, because this seemed to be the kind of things they would go for. It wouldn\u8217\'92t hurt people straight up, but it would make a statement. This night, I had a similar dream again, and was taught about how to observe energy. I didn\u8217\'92t make a lot of progress this night, possibly because my head was elsewhere. So, after a few exercises, I was sent to bed. The next day, I entered office somewhat early, and was instantly asked to join an emergency meeting. We were tasked with creating coverage in a way that prevented major panic. We first thought of spinning it as a technical problem, but it soon became clear that the issues had already been leaked out among the regular population, so this was no longer an issue. Then, we were told to come to a secret location, because they wanted to show us something. It had been kept as a secret, to prevent revolutionaries from knowing beforehand about this, but the Council had secretly been working on new vehicles. We entered a hangar, and saw ten weirdly shaped planes. They looked like a weird hybrid of a transport plane and a rocket. The technology seemed quite primitive, and high tech at the same time. We were told by an engineer that it was built for cross-shard transport. It could take off and land almost vertically, and fly in the atmosphere of a shard. We were explained the technical features of the planes. After being toured around the facility, we were told that this would be the trump card in the battle against the revolt. The revolting people were thinking they were safe, since there was no real transport possible anymore, but, they didn\u8217\'92t know of these vehicles yet. My mind was with Christopher, and his starting revolt. I wondered if they would have a chance against the specialist forces that would man these gliders. I was interrupted by one of the project leads, who asked what I thought of these new gliders. I thought for a moment, and answered that it was a clear sign that we were starting to move forward as a society. It showed that we were almost back on the same technical level that we were before the Event. He smiled, and said he agreed with me on that, and was really happy about the results the glider project had yielded. I asked him why there were no weapon systems on the outside of the gliders. He answered that they didn\u8217\'92t want it to have a too oppressive appearance. The vehicles were, in principle, designed  as multi-purpose vehicles. Their first usage would be of paramilitary kind, but after that they could also have use for emergency transportations, VIP transit, and other, important tasks that had no military benefit. Besides, he continued, shards are tiny to the point where they have very few options for military use of external armaments. The only real way to engage in a military way is by landing, followed by ground combat. But, he added, this was not the main purpose of these vehicles.\line \line After the presentation of the new gliders, I went back to the office, and wrote my article. I handed it in a few hours later, and decided to go home. That night, I dreamt again. Within a few seconds, I managed to think of a landscape, and met the Entity. We practiced walking around through my own past. Then, he told me that, actually, there\u8217\'92s nothing keeping me to my own past, but I could also walk around through the world around me, at a certain moment in time. So, if I remembered what I was doing during the event, I could travel around in the world from that time. I would still need to be wary of the fact that time still moves forward, but transit can, in theory, be instant, as long as you\u8217\'92re able to think of the place where you want to go. I thought about the day of the event. I saw myself sit in my chair, watching the news. I saw myself pick up the phone, and talk to Mary. I saw myself pet my own cat. I tried to pet the cat, but it didn\u8217\'92t reply. I figured that I was merely an observer, and not a being within the world I was seeing around me. I tried to open the door, but couldn\u8217\'92t. The Entity appeared next to me, and said that I should instead imagine the hallway. I did so, and suddenly I was walking there. I walked through the hallway, and noticed it was really quiet in the building for the time of day. I guessed most people must have been watching television at this point. I stood still for a moment, bewildered by the amazing power I suddenly seemed to have got. I didn\u8217\'92t really know how to control it yet, but it seemed I was suddenly able to observe events that had happened in the past. I decided to continue walking. I thought of where I wanted to go next. I decided to look at my boyfriend (I guess by now ex-boyfriends) work. I closed my eyes, and concentrated for a moment. I suddenly heard him teaching children.  When I opened my eyes, I saw a classroom full of kids. They must have not been aware of the Event having occurred yet, because they were still busy working on math exercises. I looked at Charles, who seemed to happily enjoy doing his job. For a moment I forgot about all the things that happened since that moment, and felt in a way I hadn\u8217\'92t felt before. I wanted to hug him, and moved towards him. As I got close to him, I saw the scene fade away. I was back in my own room, and the Entity was standing in front of me. He explained that I should not grow attached to the past, because that will make reality harder to bear. I nodded in confirmation, hurt by the reality I was put back into. He told me that he thought it would be best to keep the lessons at this for now, and to continue on a later point. I agreed, although I felt sad for not being able to see more of the past, but could see the risks to removing myself from the world for too long. \line The days after this, I was occupied with the revolt that was going on. The gliders had been sent away, but only three of them had returned a few days later. This called for investigation, which was started a few days after. However, it seemed the Council was permanently one move behind, because by the time this had happened, the water supply was taken over by the Revolt. They seemed to be mostly concerned with annoying us, and not actually doing damage. This struck me as at least somewhat noble, although their strategy had shifted significantly after William\u8217\'92s death. This made me wonder if his execution had been a good idea. I sighed, and tried to think of other things, because the thought of William\u8217\'92s execution was already extremely sad without the thought of it being useless added to it. \line The blocking off of the water supply did not immediately affect life in the Capital much. After a day, the Council started to set rations to water, and limited the flow of water to houses. The water storage of the Capital would be enough for about a week, I heard from reliable sources. I was tasked with writing articles on how to save water, and articles aimed at saving public morale. In the streets you could see people getting more worried by the day. It seemed the sense that the Council was capable of protecting everyone was dwindling by the hour. Most of the entertainment-based parts of society grinded to a halt, because people no longer felt motivated to do them. Even though all that had happened was a limit to the water supply, it felt as though our very existence was put at risk. Meanwhile, I mostly felt a strange sense of excitement. I wasn\u8217\'92t scared for the future, because I had seen the leaders of the Revolt, and knew they weren\u8217\'92t trying to hurt people, so I could just observe the show down of two powers. A few days later, observers found out that the water supply was vacated, just before a military intervention was due. The gliders the revolutionaries had captured had flown away behind a cloud, destination unknown. The information on where they were going would probably take days to arrive by cable car. Gliders had not yet been spread around the world, and no real mass communications systems existed yet. So, the revolutionaries were gone without a trace, and it would take a week for their position to become known again. In that time, they could just haze the Council, showing people the limits of the power of the Council.\line \line As the revolt went back to the background, I started to relax again. Even though we all knew they would strike again soon, life got back to sort of normal. I was able to focus again during a dream. I decided to focus on the day the Earth broke apart into pieces. I managed to see myself at the spot I was at that moment. The Entity told me that I should know that I\u8217\'92m not in any way bound by my real self. Just because I, so far, had only stood on the ground didn\u8217\'92t mean that I necessarily was bound by gravity. He told me to try to fly, by focusing on being light, and going up.  I tried to do so, but nothing happened. He told me to think that I was an object in water, bubbling back to the surface. I tried to do so, and focused deeply on this. To my own amazement, I left the ground. I could suddenly hover in the air, in a totally strange way. Sure, I\u8217\'92ve dreamt of being able to fly before, but this was different, since it was me who was controlling my flight. I enjoyed the moment for a bit, and then flew to a nearby shard. I saw people sitting next to a house that had burned down. Their shard was tiny, and seemed to have no resources at all. I thought: these people have no chance of survival, whatsoever. I got really down for a moment, thinking of the fact that these people had already died, and probably of starvation. I decided to move on, and fly along. I saw lots of people stuck on small shards, but also quite a few bigger shards that seemed to actually have a chance of survival. I then thought it would be a good moment to see how my cat was doing. So, I flew in the direction where London had been. The sun was still somewhat visible, so I could derive the direction of north. The Entity interrupted me, saying there\u8217\'92s no need to fly at this kind of a low speed. Instead, I could go a lot faster, just by thinking of going faster. I didn\u8217\'92t really understand what he meant. He tried a second time, saying, basically, it\u8217\'92s as though you think you\u8217\'92re in a tunnel, and the lights are passing at an increasing rate. It\u8217\'92s all about finding the metaphore that allows you to understand the world, and therefore manipulate it. I thought about that for a moment, and then focused on the concept of lights flashing by. I could feel myself increase velocity as I increased the frequency at which the lights passed by. In no-time I was seeing shards that looked more like the suburbs of London. I flew towards the outer rim, where my home would have been. It was quite tricky to figure out where I precisely was, because shards had shifted in vertical as well as horizontal positions. After some time, I found a shard which I recognised as being only a few streets away from my home. Therefore, I started to look at the shards around it. As I did this, I could, move around at an increasingly precise way. I no longer was limited by needing to move around, instead, as I started to want to be somewhere, I suddenly was there. I didn\u8217\'92t know how I learned to do this, but I suddenly was able to do so. After looking at around fifteen different shards, I found my own flat. Here the Entity interrupted me, saying: if you get near a place which you already know, you have to take special care. You might enter the world you want to have existed, instead of the world that actually existed. I thought about that for a moment, and then replied: how do I take care of this? He replied that I would mostly have to move slowly, and try not to get too emotionally invested in the things I might find. I replied that I understood. I took a deep breath, and moved slowly towards my appartment building. Most of the windows of the building had gone, but the building itself seemed to be mostly intact. I looked at the front-door, and moved to the hallway behind it. There, I found out that most of the lights had broken, and the internal walls had cracks in them. However, other than that, it was still fine. Some of the rooms had a smell of fire in them, so there was quite extensive damage. It seemed that most of the contents of the building would probably not survive for much longer. Normally, sprinklers would take out the fire, but these relied on the water supply, and since this shard\u8217\'92s water network was cut off from any water supplies, there was no way for that to happen. Besides that, there was no fire department that would be able to reach it. Hopefully though, it wouldn\u8217\'92t totally perish in the fire. I sighed and took a moment to regain my calm, trying not to get too emotional over the thought of my home being utterly destroyed. Even though I hadn\u8217\'92t lived there for over five years now, I still felt like it was my place most of all places I had ever lived in. I walked on, towards my own apartment. I reached it a bit later, and took a moment before entering. As I entered, I saw that it was quite a mess. Most of the objects in the room had been severely damaged, or destroyed. There was water everywhere, probably from the earthquakes before the Event broke apart the world. There was no fire though, so that was something. I was looking around for the cat, but didn\u8217\'92t find him. I didn\u8217\'92t find a dead cat either, which struck me as good news. So, I decided to look for clues on where it could have gone. I found some fur on one of the window stills; he had been shedding a lot lately. I exited the window through the same window, and saw that it had probably followed a water pipe on the outside of the building. I flew next to it, looking carefully for evidence of a cat having walked there. I found a few cat hairs on a point where the water pipe crossed an emergency staircase. I guessed the cat may have taken the staircase down to street level, and followed that route. Down the staircase, I found a few people, sitting next to the building. They were my neighbors, who had always been nice people, although they had a weird hobby of making lots of strange noises during the night. I don\u8217\'92t mean bed-related, but actually strange noises, like, the kind of noises you would hear in a 70s horror movie. I observed them for a moment. They seemed to be in shock of the event. This took me a moment to realize, but it finally dawned on me that, to them, the Event had only just happened. I lived five years after it, but to them, this had happened only about an hour ago. They had been watching stupid soap series on television, and suddenly, their world had broken into pieces. I felt a kind of .. Towards them, because they had just lost their everything. Ah well, at least they would stand a high chance of survival, because there was still a supermarket with quite high stocks on this shard, and, since most people were at work at this time, they wouldn\u8217\'92t have to share their supplies with a lot of people. This gave me at least some feeling of relief for them. I stood there for another moment, and then continued looking for my cat. It may have seemed stupid to almost everyone in the world, but, to me, my cat was extremely important at that moment. I didn\u8217\'92t care about it surviving, but I did want to know what had happened to it. I found more cat hairs on the path to a small nook near the building, in which the cat was hiding. It seemed scared, but otherwise fine. I wanted to pet it, but realized I couldn\u8217\'92t, so I didn\u8217\'92t attempt to do so. I felt a sadness coming up, almost overcoming me. I fought back, and managed to stay calm. I stood up, and walked around again. When I turned around a corner, I met the Entity. He told me I may want to learn how to exit this world myself. I confirmed this, and he said it\u8217\'92s actually quite simple. The trick is to close your eyes, and think about your real-world position. This means it was vitally important for me to remember where I went to bed in the real world, to prevent getting lost here forever. Or, at least, until he would find me, and put me back in my own body, in my own world. I decided this would be a good moment to try this out, and closed my eyes. I thought of my room in the Capital, and my bed. After a few seconds, I woke up in my own room. Somehow, I did so exactly at the same time of my alarm clock. This struck me as odd, but I didn\u8217\'92t think too much of it. Compared to the other things happening, waking up at a convenient time seemed to be unimportant.\line \line For a few days, nothing seemed to happen. This made everyone in the capital wary, because there was no way the revolt had just ended there. After that, the revolt continued in strength. First, they had taken over arms factories, and later they switched to stealing fuel.}{\f1\fs22\b1\i0  }{\f4\fs22\b1\i1  }{\f3\fs22\b0\i0 I started to feel like this could not continue on nicely. They started to become increasingly aggressive, meaning the Council would soon have no choice but to attack fiercely.\line \line Just before the climax of the revolt, I ran into John. He was eating in the canteen of the building I was working in. I didn\loch\af3\hich\af3\dbch\af3\uc1\u8217\'92t know him, but there was something special about him. I couldn\u8217\'92t figure out why, but I just had the feeling that he was somehow important. I shrugged, and continued on my way. That evening, I thought about me running into John, as I was about to fall asleep. After falling asleep, I met the Entity, who told me that I had an important role to play in events to come, but that he couldn\u8217\'92t tell me why. He did however tell me that it might be wise to look into John, and who he is. So, I tried to head back to the scene at the canteen. I was able to recreate the scene in my head without much effort, and soon I was sitting on a table near him. I saw him sit there, alone, and had a feeling he was unhappy about something. I decided to follow him after he left the canteen. He walked back to his workspace. I saw him work on an \u8230\'85 \u8230\'85. However, this didn\u8217\'92t feel like the sort of thing he would want to work on. I wanted to see what had happened beforehand, causing him to work on something he didn\u8217\'92t want to work on. I tried very hard to travel to a different moment in time, but was unable to. I decided therefore to just leave this for now. I closed my eyes and focused. After some effort, I woke up.}}
