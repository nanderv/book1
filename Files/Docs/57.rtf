When I returned, I was asked what  I had been doing, leaving the Capital without an explicit task. I said that I had a lead there, but it turned out to be nothing. They wanted to ask more questions, but I answered that I had promised the lead to stay anonymous, and didn\u8217\'92t want to break the trust I was given. So, I was let off the hook.\line \line }{\f2\fs22\b0\i0 About a month after William\loch\af2\hich\af2\dbch\af2\uc1\u8217\'92s death, my dreams started to return. I wasn\u8217\'92t sure what they meant this time, but felt like it wanted to teach me something. It seemed unable to explain what it was trying to tell me though. The dreams all went in the same way: first, I was walking on a plane of light, with a starry sky above me. Then, the ground disappeared, and I was floating through the stars. Finally, I fell through a strange hole in the sky, and ended on a small shard. After that, I woke up, every time. Just like the other dreams that were related to the Entity, I felt a strange truthfulness to this dream. My mind was, in a strange way, perfectly certain that this dream was real, in the same way you\u8217\'92re sure that the book you\u8217\'92re holding is real. So, naturally, I was very confused by these dreams. A few nights later, it was as though the dream suddenly got clearer. The dream still started in the same way, with me standing on a sort of plane of light. However, as the plane disappeared, I felt as though I suddenly had wings. I could fly around freely, not bound by gravity, or any other law of physics. As I flew around, I noticed the stars around me changing color. I then heard a voice, which I somehow already recognized. It told me that if I focused, I could change the world around me. So, I concentrated and was able to change the color of the sky around us to a dark blue tint. The Entity said I could do better, if I thought of bigger things. It told me I can already do a lot more than I think I can, but just need to trust myself to do so. I didn\u8217\'92t know what to think of, so I decided to just think about the place where I had spent my last holiday. It took some effort, but after a while, I could feel the sand between my feet. Then, I could see the sea splash near me. I could feel the water stream over my feet, moving the sand underneath me. I turned around, and saw the rocky inland. There was a path going up the cliffs, towards a lighthouse. When I turned around again, I saw a strange man standing there. He wasn\u8217\'92t there during my holidays, so I was surprised. He looked at me for a moment, and then walked towards me. He introduced himself as the Entity, but said he would prefer the name \u8230\'85, because that sounds more like he\u8217\'92s a living being, instead of a monster. He did a step to the right, and suddenly we where on the roof of a giant building. It had become nighttime. He told me that he wasn\u8217\'92t from our universe, and that he had powers that weren\u8217\'92t from this world. Simply put, from the perspective of our world, he could use magic. I looked bewildered at him, but continued listening. He continued, saying he saw in me a person with great potential, if I learned the right things. He told me that people can have an affinity for magic, just like he has. The breaking of the world-border did not only let him through, but also let some magic into our world. This brings risk, but also possibilities. I asked if this meant that I could perform magic, and if so, what kinds of magic. He told me that he was certain I could build an affinity for some types of magic, but wasn\u8217\'92t sure what types would work. Not everyone can do everything, and some types of magic are highly inadvisable to use. I asked him if he could teach me. He nodded, and with a movement of his hands, we changed locations again. This time, we were standing on the top of a hill. First things first, he said, it\u8217\'92s important to realize that, even though we\u8217\'92re in a dream, it still abides mostly by the rules of the real world. He threw a rock off of the hill, and you could see it fall in the same way you\u8217\'92d expect a rock to fall. He said that this made it a good place to train. \line He told me the first thing to realize is that the magic comes from a type of energy that\u8217\'92s around us. It has been there ever since the Event. It streams through the world, in the same way the storm always rotates. Any thing you\u8217\'92re doing with magic is basically changing the flow of this Energy. The Energy can be used for a lot of things, such as looking for things on long distance, or giving someone far away advice. He told me that basically, most of the things books from the old Earth told people about magic was, in some way or another, possible. He said that I would probably be best at observing, since that fits the nature of my character best. This probably also explained me wanting to become a journalist. He told me to focus on something I wanted to find. I thought about my boyfriend, Charles. For a moment, nothing seemed to happen, which frightened me. The chance of him having died during, or after the event was actually quite big. \u8230\'85 told me to relax, and focus on finding him. If I didn\u8217\'92t focus, I wouldn\u8217\'92t find anything, he continued. So, I sighed, and regained my focus. I thought of him, his smile, his eyes, his hair, and could slowly see him stand before me. It was as though I slowly built up the scene of the place where he was. He was living in a farm, somewhere outside the reach of the cable car system. It seemed this shard wasn\u8217\'92t mapped yet. When I looked around, I felt weird. I saw a woman stand near him, with a child next to her. I just knew the child was his, just like I knew the woman was his. I felt my stomach turn. \u8230\'85 must have seen what happened to me, because he broke off the scene. He told me this was the disadvantage of this skill. I could -sometimes- see a scene, but it can also be negative. Also, he warned me, not everything you\u8217\'92re seeing is real. Sometimes you\u8217\'92re seeing your own wishes, or fears. He told me he felt like the scene I just saw was probably real, but added, that it didn\u8217\'92t really matter, because I wasn\u8217\'92t destined to meet Charles again. I started crying, and stumbled out: how do you know all of this? The reply was, because I\u8217\'92m powerful to the point where I might as well be a god. I looked at him for a moment, and nodded. I mean, really, yes, he is a god. He broke apart the earth, and rebuilt it. His will is what made this world the way it is now. He then told me I had learned enough today, and should get some normal sleep before waking up. I nodded in agreement, and, with a movement of a hand, he changed the world into a sleeping room. I laid down on the bed, and fell asleep. No significant dreams were dreamed from there, and I woke up in the normal reality again. I woke up in confusion, and with a heavy headache. I drank a glass of water, followed by a cup of coffee, and my head seemed to calm down again.\line \line I then went to work, still thinking of what I had seen the night before. My task for today was writing about the way the world had turned more peaceful, without the revolutionaries fucking everything up. I thought, sarcastically, that this would probably change again soon. Christopher didn\u8217\'92t seem like the kind of person to give up on his dreams. But, that\u8217\'92s not something the people in the Capital had any interest in reading, so I wasn\u8217\'92t writing about that. Instead, I wrote about how order had, once again, prevailed. I finished my work without interesting things happening, and went back home. As I entered home, I heard about the cable car strike. I was not surprised, because this seemed to be the kind of things they would go for. It wouldn\u8217\'92t hurt people straight up, but it would make a statement. This night, I had a similar dream again, and was taught about how to observe energy. I didn\u8217\'92t make a lot of progress this night, possibly because my head was elsewhere. So, after a few exercises, I was sent to bed. The next day, I entered office somewhat early, and was instantly asked to join an emergency meeting. We were tasked with creating coverage in a way that prevented major panic. We first thought of spinning it as a technical problem, but it soon became clear that the issues had already been leaked out among the regular population, so this was no longer an issue. Then, we were told to come to a secret location, because they wanted to show us something. It had been kept as a secret, to prevent revolutionaries from knowing beforehand about this, but the Council had secretly been working on new vehicles. We entered a hangar, and saw ten weirdly shaped planes. They looked like a weird hybrid of a transport plane and a rocket. The technology seemed quite primitive, and high tech at the same time. We were told by an engineer that it was built for cross-shard transport. It could take off and land almost vertically, and fly in the atmosphere of a shard. We were explained the technical features of the planes. After being toured around the facility, we were told that this would be the trump card in the battle against the revolt. The revolting people were thinking they were safe, since there was no real transport possible anymore, but, they didn\u8217\'92t know of these vehicles yet. My mind was with Christopher, and his starting revolt. I wondered if they would have a chance against the specialist forces that would man these gliders. I was interrupted by one of the project leads, who asked what I thought of these new gliders. I thought for a moment, and answered that it was a clear sign that we were starting to move forward as a society. It showed that we were almost back on the same technical level that we were before the Event. He smiled, and said he agreed with me on that, and was really happy about the results the glider project had yielded. I asked him why there were no weapon systems on the outside of the gliders. He answered that they didn\u8217\'92t want it to have a too oppressive appearance. The vehicles were, in principle, designed  as multi-purpose vehicles. Their first usage would be of paramilitary kind, but after that they could also have use for emergency transportations, VIP transit, and other, important tasks that had no military benefit. Besides, he continued, shards are tiny to the point where they have very few options for military use of external armaments. The only real way to engage in a military way is by landing, followed by ground combat. But, he added, this was not the main purpose of these vehicles.\line \line After the presentation of the new gliders, I went back to the office, and wrote my article. I handed it in a few hours later, and decided to go home. That night, I dreamt again. }}
