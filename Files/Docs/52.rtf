\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i1 \line }{\f2\fs24\b1\i1 TODO: ADD DRAMA}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 \line I didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t agree when William decided to give his life up for the cause. I thought it was silly, and wouldn\u8217\'92t yield any results. But then again, Willem and I had almost never agreed on anything. It was as though he lacked the guts to actually act on his ideas. It seemed he knew what was going on, but didn\u8217\'92t see that, nothing would ever change without action. Nothing can be free without sacrifice. My name is Christopher Tell, and this is the story of my fight for freedom.}{\f3\fs24\b0\i0 \line \line From the beginning of the Voice, I have been one of the more important trustees. I was one of the first ten people to join, and joined around a month after the Voice was started. Back then we were still mostly a group of people talking about how the world should be. It always annoyed me how little people were willing / wanting to do to create the world they claimed they wanted so badly. I more than once mentioned to William that I didn\loch\af3\hich\af3\dbch\af3\uc1\u8217\'92t agree with the course of action we were taking. We had long conversations about it, but in the end, we disagreed, and, the Voice was his responsibility, so his opinion was the one that was taken.\line \line When we started to become more active, I got my hopes up. We started to spread throughout the shards, meaning we now had the power to act. A strategic rebellion or strike could give us the opportunity to demand change. The thing with cable car transportation is: if the cable car people on one end go on strike, there\u8217\'92s nothing you can do to get the system running again, it\u8217\'92s simply stalled. I explained this strategy to William, but he seemed to be appalled by it. He explained that this would only hurt the normal civilians, and that the people in power could just sit through it, because they had stockpiled all they could need for quite some time. I disagreed, arguing that they wouldn\u8217\'92t want the perception of their control being gone. He said that this would mean they would need to go out to war, or accept that they lost face, either by submitting, or by waiting it out. Either way, we would have made enemies of the general population, instead of friends. \line \line I was mostly involved in organizing local events. I always thought we should have a more pro-active role, and not limit us to not using violence. If the Council is going to use it\u8217\'92s power, then we should meet it. You can\u8217\'92t fight intolerance with tolerance, that doesn\u8217\'92t work. So, I tried to change policy. If the top didn\u8217\'92t want to listen, I thought, then I needed to work around them.\line The problem with freedom is that you need some of it to fight for it. Simple example: if you\u8217\'92re in prison, you\u8217\'92re not in a position to fight for getting more freedom. This means that limitations in freedom should always be acted upon. No exceptions. \line \line You may wonder if I was responsible for the terrorist attack that happened, and was put on our blame. I wasn\u8217\'92t, but I was glad that it happened. It meant that we finally had made an impact, and could move forward. I suggested to double down, and use this opportunity to strike. I argued that, since we already lost our moral high ground, we might as well play that game. William asked me if I was happy with the terrorist attack, because it had given me fuel for my fire. I replied that I thought it could bring opportunities. William looked at me in a really strange way. I think he may have thought I was somehow responsible for the terrorist attack.  \line \line From the terrorist attack on, it started to go downhill for }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 the Voice.}{\f3\fs24\b0\i0  Since we weren\loch\af3\hich\af3\dbch\af3\uc1\u8217\'92t really defending ourselves, it seemed that we lost most of our strength. We lost a lot of members overnight, because the government now officially outlawed our organization, being a terrorist group. Besides that, the general population no longer loved us, and instead had decided to hate us.\line \line I remember hearing of the death of William. It was spread throughout the news. The leader of the rebellion had been executed. But, worse than that, he had apologized publicly for the acts of the Voice, saying it had been a big mistake. There was evidence of this shown in every newspaper. The newspapers were all lyrical about it; the war on terror had been won, and the Council had, once again, showed that it was very capable of protecting and serving everyone.. William had left me and George as people responsible for the after-care of the Voice. \line \line George and I both agreed immediately that we couldn\u8217\'92t just do nothing. If we did nothing, we would have lost, and William\u8217\'92s sacrifice would have been in vain. So, we set to plan a strike. We wanted the Council to feel that it wasn\u8217\'92t all-powerful, and that we were a group they should keep into account. Our plan was to cut them off from the rest of the world, by cutting all transport with the Capital. Although this would not go without a hitch, the actual plan was rather simple: arrange that all Cable Car systems break down at the same time. These systems were seen by everyone as vital for the entirety of society. So, paradoxally, nobody even thought about defending them. Anyone attacking or damaging these systems must be out of their mind, was probably the reasoning. Besides, there are too many terminals, and defensive forces are scarce. We didn\u8217\'92t want to destroy the systems, but merely disable them for a while. Destroying them would actually be tricky, since the helicopter fleet was mostly out of service, because fuel and spare parts had almost run out. So, any link permanently destroyed may have more serious consequences than anyone could ever want. It could, in the worst case, mean that people in some areas starve to death, because transport is no longer possible, meaning they are cut off from food supplies.\line \line We found out that the system\u8217\'92s engines were being kept up to date by the so-called power engineers. These people were responsible for fueling the engines that power the cable. By turning them off, one side no longer provides power, causing the engines at the other side to stall. This should, according to our calculations, not cause major damage, but should take a system out until it gets restarted at both sides. This could disconnect the Capital from the rest of the shards, giving us the required time to organize a proper revolt. We found the required engineers, and managed to convince them. This was surprisingly easy, because most engineers have a natural hatred towards being taken for granted. And what\u8217\'92s a better way to show how important you are than to stop doing your job for a few days?  They told us that if they removed the transformers from the electrical cabinet, there would be no way to turn it back on until they wanted to turn it back on. This seemed like a fine plan, and we all agreed to set it in motion. A few weeks later, it was doomsday. We timed it so all cable cars stopped working just before Christmas season. We sent out our demands as a note, attached to the last cars that made it to the Citadel. After that, we went silent. The Citadel had no way to talk back, and we had no way to talk to them. For a week, this silence continued. We could measure from the wires that they were trying to send smaller packages over the line, but were unable to. The lack of transformers hadn\u8217\'92t just made the system not get power from our side. It also meant that, on our side, no carriages could be loaded. Most importantly, however, it put the engines into emergency brake mode, meaning the cable was forcefully kept still. The people on the other end must have realized this, because they tried to use the maximum amount of force that could be used without breaking the cable. The engine however, didn\u8217\'92t give an inch. Thus, we were able to hold our blockade for the time we wanted. After the week, we re-enabled one of the cables, and sent a small package over the line. It contained our first few demands. They were:}
\par\plain {\f3\fs24\b0\i0 1. A representative council that\loch\af3\hich\af3\dbch\af3\uc1\u8217\'92s chosen democratically}
\par\plain {\f3\fs24\b0\i0 2. A solid bill of rights}
\par\plain {\f3\fs24\b0\i0 3. A legal system that\loch\af3\hich\af3\dbch\af3\uc1\u8217\'92s based on known to be working concepts}
\par\plain {\f3\fs24\b0\i0 4. A means for everyone to verify what the council is doing, and why.\line \line After this, we waited. We got a message in return, asking us to stop the blockade. They did add to that statement that we should at least let medical packages come through. We agreed to that part, and shipped their requested list of medical things with a secondary shipment. After this, we waited again. One thing to realize is that, once one side adds a heavy payload, the other side will instantly notice. That side then has two options: either to let it come through, or to stop it mid-flight. This means that sending people over without the other side agreeing means risking that they suffocate mid-flight. This meant that, even though one of the systems was technically strong enough to support a quite extensive military regiment, sending it across may mean that they would never arrive. A few days later, a reply message arrived. It said they would consider it if we released the cable cars. They said however, that change like this would take time. Finally, it was added that none of the people involved in the strike would logically be permitted to be involved in writing the new bill of rights, since they voided their rights by acting against the people in the world.}}
