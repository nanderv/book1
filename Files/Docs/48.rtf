\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i1 My name is John. I am not that important, but I nevertheless want to tell you my story. I was only a few years old when the Event happened, so my story differs quite a bit from how others remember it.\line \line }{\f2\fs24\b0\i0 I came home after school. I was playing with my toy trains. The people here needed me to go where they want to go. My train brought them to where they want to go. As the train made it\loch\af2\hich\af2\dbch\af2\uc1\u8217\'92s fifth round around the city, something strange started to happen. The rails were shaking. The people on the train were scared. The train derailed. The people in it started screaming. The train stopped, and the people got out. Most of them weren\u8217\'92t hurt. They walked off to their homes. The train was left behind, next to the tracks. An enormous woman screamed from far below. \u8220\'93John, downstairs, now\u8221\'94, the giant screamed. I sighed, and went downstairs. \u8220\'93What is it mom?\u8221\'94, I asked. She looked scared. Mom never looked scared before. That made me scared. I asked again: \u8220\'93What is wrong, mom?\u8221\'94. This time mom answered, in panic. She said she didn\u8217\'92t know. She hid with me under the table. I didn\u8217\'92t know what was going on. I asked mom if we were playing hide and seek. She answered that it was something like that. Then the ground started shaking again. This time it was heavier than the previous time. The roof started to fall. I screamed. Mom also screamed. Then, it got silent again. We walked out of the house. Our neighbor\u8217\'92s house was gone. It was one big mess. Suddenly, something strange started to happen. The street next to Nick\u8217\'92s house was falling. This sounds strange, but it was true. Nick\u8217\'92s house disappeared. I started crying, because Nick is my friend. We played together a lot. \line }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 I guess Nick won Hide-and-seek.\line }{\f2\fs24\b0\i0 ..}
