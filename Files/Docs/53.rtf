\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f1\fs36\b1\i0 Epilogue}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 \line Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub. Oh, sorry, I didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t see you there. I\u8217\'92m Blubarious the Great, the leader of the Goldfish family. I\u8217\'92ve never bothered much with the world of mankind. They always struck me as a stupid bunch, not really willing to take much interest in anything but their own world. However, it seems they got us all into quite a bit of trouble, and, as always, it was caused by their destructive search for knowledge. After killing uncountable animals, just so they can see how they }{\f1\fs24\b1\i1 used to}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1  work, they decided they wanted to know how the world works. They found it out by the only way humans know: destroying it.\line You may wonder why I even understand the world around me. The reason is simple, we Goldfish always listen. We listen and learn, two skills humans claim to have, but rarely show.}

However, some of us became touched by the energy that had entered our world, and became much more intelligent than any other of our kind had been before.\line }}
